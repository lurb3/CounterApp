The goal of this project is to count and control the time spent coding, working, cooking, etc.
You can control the time you spent learning/doing a specific subject and track/analyse it.

This app is a WIP project and my main purpose of it is to learn Javascript, Php and databases (MYSQL)
I also want to learn how to make an API and make all the connectins/requests to it.
